# Cluster CMS

Cluster CMS is a lightweight contact management solution with built-in Gmail integration. 

# Background and Overview

Cluster is designed to be a lightweight alternative to traditional CMS software. Cluster does one thing, and does it well: it gives you a central focal point where you can focus on what matters â€” engaging with your client. By integrating with Gmail's API, we take the logistical responsibility of organizing your emails off your hands, ensuring that you never lose another important email in the stack! 

# Functionality and MVP

- User authentication using OAuth2
- Contacts CRUD
- Gmail integration
- __BONUS:__ Tasks CRUD for Contacts

# Technologies and Technical Challenges

Cluster will be built using Express and MongoDB for server and database solutions, respectively, and React for the front-end. We will be using Node's runtime to tie it all together. This stack is commonly referred to as MERN. We will also be using Google's Gmail API.
